        <h2>My Idea</h2>
            <p>For the Lia Project, I plan to create a motion graphics/3D commercial for my cousin's barbershop, Haven. The project will feature 3D-rendered elements that represent the barbershop, including scissors, clippers, a barber pole, and the Haven logo, all designed in Blender. After creating these assets, I'll render them as individual clips and bring them into Adobe Premiere Pro for editing. The final commercial will be crafted by adding transitions, music, sound effects, and other finishing touches. During the first week (Nov 11-17), I will focus on creating the 3D elements. In the second week (Nov 18-24), I’ll work on refining the lighting, camera angles, and rendering the clips. In the final week (Nov 25-Dec 2), I’ll bring everything into Premiere Pro for the final edit.</p>
