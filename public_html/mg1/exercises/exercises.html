    <h1>1.3 KeyFrame & 1.4 Masking Exercises</h1>

    <div class="video-container">

    <p>The animation begins with a title text zooming out as a mask reveals a hidden word, demonstrating masking and staging. A ball bounces across the screen using squash and stretch, showing keyframe animation and anticipation. Text transitions smoothly to a second text, followed by a background change to white where a star bounces with exaggeration. Rotating text leads into a transition with a cube exiting the screen, illustrating rotation, slow in/out, and anticipation. The final text appears on a white background, combining keyframe and masking techniques, with my name and labels included. Disney principles used include Squash and Stretch, Anticipation, Staging, Follow Through, Slow In/Out, and Exaggeration.</p>

    <p>In this project, I learned how to use track mattes and shapes in After Effects to create dynamic text effects. I animated text with expressions and combined mattes for more complex visuals. I customized the project by adding the word “Dreamer” over a purple-pink city background, creating a smooth, dreamy reveal effect that blends technical skills with personal style.</p>
